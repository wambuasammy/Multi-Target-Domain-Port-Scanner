# Multi-Target-Domain-Port-Scanner


## Description
This is a simple Python script for scanning open ports on one or multiple targets using multithreading. The script prompts the user to input target IP addresses or hostnames, as well as the range of ports to scan. It then scans each target for open ports within the specified range and displays the results.

## Features
- Scans one or multiple targets for open ports
- Multithreaded port scanning for improved performance
- Supports specifying a range of ports to scan
- Prints open ports for each target after scanning

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- IPy library (install using `pip install IPy`)
